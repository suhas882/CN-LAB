#EXPERIMENT 1B#
Experiment 1: Basic Peer-to-Peer Networking with Cisco Packet Tracer
This experiment demonstrates the setup of a simple peer-to-peer (P2P) network using Cisco Packet Tracer, where two PCs are directly connected to test basic IP connectivity.

Objective
To establish and verify basic peer-to-peer communication by:

Connecting two PCs using a copper straight-through cable

Assigning IP addresses manually

Testing connectivity using the ping command

Requirements
Cisco Packet Tracer

2 PCs (PC0 and PC1)

1 Copper Straight-Through Cable

ðŸ”§ Experiment Steps
1. Create a New Network
Launch Cisco Packet Tracer

Open a new workspace/project

2. Add Devices
Drag and drop PC0 and PC1 into the workspace

3. Connect the PCs
Use a Copper Straight-Through Cable

Connect PC0 â†’ FastEthernet0

Connect PC1 â†’ FastEthernet0

4. Configure IP Addresses
On each PC, go to:

Desktop â†’ IP Configuration

PC0
IP Address: 192.168.1.1

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

PC1
IP Address: 192.168.1.2

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

5. Test the Connection
Open Command Prompt on PC0

Type: ping 192.168.1.2

A successful reply confirms connectivity
