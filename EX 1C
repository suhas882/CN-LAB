Part 3: Study of Network Cables and Color Codes
 Overview
This section explores the different types of network cables used in computer networking, focusing on both copper and fiber optic cables. It also details the standard color codes for copper straight-through and crossover cables, along with their typical purposes and use cases in network setups.

1. Types of Network Cables
 Copper Cables
ðŸ”¹ Straight-Through Cable
Purpose: Connects different types of devices

Examples: PC to Switch, Switch to Router

Wiring: Identical on both ends (Pin 1 to Pin 1, Pin 2 to Pin 2, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ Crossover Cable
Purpose: Connects similar types of devices directly

Examples: PC to PC, Switch to Switch

Wiring: Transmit and receive pairs are crossed (TX â†” RX)

 Fiber Optic Cables
ðŸ”¹ Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)
Light Source: Infrared laser (1310 or 1550 nm)

Distance: Long-distance (up to kilometers)

Use Case: WAN links, long-haul telecom

ðŸ”¹ Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)
Light Source: Infrared LED (850 nm)

Distance: Short to medium distances

Use Case: LANs, data centers, building backbones

2.  Standard Color Codes for Copper Cables
Straight-Through Cable (TIA/EIA 568B Standard)
Pin	Wire Color
1	White/Orange
2	Orange
3	White/Green
4	Blue
5	White/Blue
6	Green
7	White/Brown
8	Brown

Note: Both ends use the same wiring pattern.

 Crossover Cable Pinout
Pin	End 1 (Color)	End 2 (Color)
1	White/Orange	White/Green
2	Orange	Green
3	White/Green	White/Orange
4	Blue	Blue
5	White/Blue	White/Blue
6	Green	Orange
7	White/Brown	White/Brown
8	Brown	Brown

3.  Purpose and Usage of Each Cable Type
Cable Type	Purpose	Usage Example
Copper Straight-Through	Connects different device types	PC to Switch, Switch to Router
Copper Crossover	Connects similar device types directly	PC to PC, Switch to Switch
Single-Mode Fiber	Long-distance, high-speed transmission	WAN links, backbone connections
Multi-Mode Fiber	Medium-distance high-speed connections	LANs, data centers, buildings
