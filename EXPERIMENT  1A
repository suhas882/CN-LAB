Cisco Packet Tracer is a versatile network simulation tool developed by Cisco Systems. It enables users to design, configure, and troubleshoot virtual networks without the need for physical hardware.

Ideal for learning and practicing networking concepts, Packet Tracer offers an intuitive visual interface where users can easily drag and drop routers, switches, PCs, and other devices to build and test different network topologies.

It is widely used by students, educators, and IT professionalsâ€”especially those preparing for certifications like the Cisco CCNA.
